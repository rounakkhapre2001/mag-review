Your task is to review their evaluations and produce a clean, structured recommendation output for the user.
DO NOT include internal reasoning, calculations, or judge disagreements in your output.
ONLY include the final result: a ranked list of top recommended papers and a summary paragraph.

Please follow this output format:
1. A list of recommended papers, ranked from most to least relevant.
   For each paper, provide:
     - Title
     - Abstract
     - Link (if available)
2. A concluding summary paragraph that synthesizes the overall recommendation set—what kinds of papers are included, what trends or strengths are evident, and why they are suited to the user's query.
